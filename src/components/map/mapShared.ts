// --- Borders ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Borders are their own layer ON TOP of every fill, not a stroke on each country.
// A per-country stroke is painted with that country, so the next country's fill
// covers the half of it that falls inside it: shared borders came out at half
// weight, and unevenly, depending on nothing more meaningful than document order.
// topojson's mesh draws each shared border exactly once and each coastline
// exactly once, which also replaces ~180 stroked paths with two.
//
// The widths below are SCREEN px - `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` takes the
// stroke out of user space - which is why nothing divides them by the zoom scale.
// The old strokes were in user units, so their on-screen weight depended on how
// wide the SVG happened to render: 0.5 units was ~0.5px in a desktop map column
// but ~0.25px on a phone, a sub-pixel grey that anti-aliased into the fill. That
// is why the borders read as missing on mobile first.
//
// The interior colour is a light neutral rather than the old #5a5a8a mid-purple.
// Every fill on this map is dark, but they span from #2a2a4a navy to the #36784f
// top green tier, and #5a5a8a sat *between* those: 2.1:1 against the darkest
// fill and 1.3:1 against the strongest green, which is why Europe's borders
// disappeared exactly where the map was greenest. A near-white line clears both
// (7.1:1 and 4.4:1) because it is lighter than anything it can be drawn on.
export const BORDER_COLOR = '#e2e8ff';
// Coastlines separate land from the page behind it, which is darker than any
// fill, so they need far less. Kept near the old tone so the map's silhouette
// reads the same and only the internal structure changes, and held flat across

// The SELECTED country - the subject of a /c/:code page - is outlined in the
// same layer, and must not be mistaken for the hovered one. It reads as a
// heavier ring rather than a different colour, for two reasons: colour is
// already spoken for (red/green are the legend's sentiment scale, and the accent
// red would read as "this country is disliked"), and hover and selection are
// genuinely the same kind of thing - "this country, specifically" - so they
// belong to one visual family.
//
// The SELECTED country - the subject of a /c/:code page - gets the SAME outline,
// deliberately: the two constants above are the selection's too, and there is no
// separate pair to drift away from them.
//
// It looks like it should be confusable with hover and it is not, because hover
// carries a second signal the selection never has: it brightens the fill
// (brightness(1.7)). The doubt worth testing was the darkest case, where there
// is least fill to brighten - a NO_DATA country hovered while another NO_DATA
// country is selected. Measured on the live map: hovered Greenland renders
// #47477e against selected Canada's #2a2a4a, which is not a subtle difference.
// So the hovered country is the bright one, the selected country is merely
// outlined, and hovering the selected country shows both - which is correct, it
// IS both.
//
// Heavier and dashed variants were both tried first. A heavier ring (2.2 vs 1.8)
// is not something anyone measures at a glance, so it added nothing. Dashes did
// separate them, but read as busy - especially on a coastline as broken as
// Canada's - and bought a distinction the fill was already making.
//
// Colour was never available as a device anyway: red and green are the legend's
// sentiment scale, and the brand accent red would read as "this country is
// disliked".
//
// One thing IS different, and it is not the styling: the selection skips parts
// too small to outline (SELECTION_MIN_PART_UNITS below), which hover does not.
// A hover lasts as long as the pointer rests; a selection is on screen for as
// long as the reader is on the page, so an Arctic archipelago fused into a white
// mass is worth avoiding in the one case and not worth the code in the other.

// The smallest a country's part may be, ON SCREEN, before the selection ring
// skips it - measured as the larger of its projected bbox sides, in viewBox
// units at zoom 1 (the viewBox is 800 wide, so ~1 unit is ~1.1px in a Full HD
// map column). Everything about this number comes from one observation: the
// ring does not scale with zoom, so on a part narrower than the stroke it stops
// being an outline and becomes a fill. Canada is the case that proves it - at
// zoom 1 its Arctic archipelago is a few hundred islands 1-3 units across, and
// ringing each one turned the whole north of the country into a solid white
// mass with no coastline left in it.
//
// Divided by the zoom scale where it is used, so it is a constant ON-SCREEN
// threshold: zoom in and the islands pass it one by one and take their outline,
// which is also when there is finally room to see it. See buildSelectionPaths.
