// The caption above the map. Three states, same slot:
//
//   default  - the Opinio mark + wordmark under a line naming what the global
//              map shows. Always there, on the home map and on a detail whose
//              tint has been dismissed; no close button, nothing to return to.
//   profile  - the open opinio's avatar + name, with a close button.
//   country  - the open country's flag + name, with a close button.
//
// The last two share everything but the mark and the heading level, because they
// caption the same kind of map: "here is where the votes on THIS came from". The
// kicker is literally the same string for both (t.mapWorldThinks) - it takes no
// preposition, so it sits under either subject unchanged (see below).
//
// Closing the profile or country caption does NOT close the modal (WorldMap owns
// that state): the detail stays open and readable while the map and this caption
// drop back to the global default, which is the only way to look at the world
// map while a detail is open.
//
// In PROFILE state the name is an h1 and the kicker above it an h2.
// DesktopProfileModal carries its own h1 for the same opinio, so above 1366 the
// route has two - deliberate, see the CLAUDE.md note: the map does not render
// below 1366, and the modal heading is what guarantees the route always has one.
// The crawler-visible heading on a bare /p/<id> comes from the SPA (the worker
// only injects <head> there), which is why this one is worth carrying at all.
//
// In COUNTRY state NEITHER line is a heading - both are plain spans - and that
// is not an oversight. CountryDetailModal always carries an h1 (the localized
// "{country}: what the world thinks", keyword-front-loaded and crawler-visible
// at every width, unlike the profile modal's), so a heading here would be pure
// duplication. Worse, it would be duplication in the wrong order: this caption
// renders BEFORE the router Outlet, so an h2 kicker here would run ahead of the
// modal's h1 in the outline - the very thing the flex-col-reverse below exists
// to prevent inside the card. One h1 per country route, and the modal owns it.
//
// In the default state only the descriptive line is a heading (h2) and the
// wordmark is a plain span: on the home page the h1 is the wordmark in FilterBar
// and must stay that way, while the h2 gives home its first *content* heading -
// real words about what the map is, which it otherwise has none of. `uppercase`
// is text-transform, so the crawled text keeps its normal casing.
//
// That line describes the map it sits over, and the states do NOT show the same
// thing: the global map groups by profiles.country_code (what an opinio is
// about), the two subject maps by voter country. Hence "how the world sees each
// country" there and "what the world thinks" here - not one shared phrase.
//
// The kicker takes NO preposition ("what the world thinks", not "...thinks about
// X"). Czech and Polish would need the name inflected after one, and names never
// inflect - the same reason the country SEO templates lead with the subject, and
// the reason one kicker string covers both an opinio and a country with nothing
// added. "Czechia" over "what the world thinks" is the same sentence the country
// page's own title makes ("{country}: what the world thinks"), in the same order.
//
// Sits in a card matching the opinio cards in the sidebars (ProfileCard.tsx:243:
// rounded-xl, bg-surface-light, hairline white ring) so it reads as part of the
// same family - just larger. Slightly more opaque than a sidebar card plus a
// backdrop blur, because this one sits over the map rather than a flat panel.
// The card spans the full width of the map column (the sidebars are resizable, so
// "available width" is whatever the column currently is) rather than hugging the
// name - a content-width box jumped around as you moved between opinios.
//
// Layout is the avatar and the text column as ONE centred group, not a text cell
// centred inside a full-width card. The distinction is the whole point: a
// full-width cell centres its text in the middle of the card and leaves the
// avatar stranded at the left edge with a gap between them, which reads as a bug
// at every width wider than the name. Here the column is sized to its content
// (no flex-1) and shrinks only once the name needs the room, so the avatar always
// sits directly beside the text.
//
// The name is NOT balanced across its two lines. `text-balance` splits them
// evenly, which on a centred block re-opens the same gap - a name a hair too long
// for one line becomes two half-width lines floating away from the avatar.
// Greedy wrapping fills the first line to the column edge, so the text starts
// beside the avatar and only the shorter last line is centred under it.
//
// The name is NOT fitted to the string. Size comes from the card's own width
// (`cqi`, hence the `@container`), so every opinio is captioned at the same size
// at the same window size - a per-string fit made one name 30px and the next 22px
// on an unchanged layout, and the caption is the same object either way. Long
// names wrap instead, and the width freed by dropping the old centred text cell
// makes that rare: a 40-char statement - the input cap - holds one line at a Full
// HD map column, and only a translation that runs well past it takes a second.
//
// pointer-events-none on the wrapper: it overlays the map and must never eat a
// country hover. The close button re-enables them for itself alone.
//
// Changing subject is animated as a crossfade in place, not a re-render: the
// outgoing row sinks out while the incoming one rises in, both at once, inside
// one grid cell. useSubjectSwap holds the two subjects; each row is keyed on its
// own, so the animations replay every time, and the global state shares the key
// space with the opinios - global -> opinio animates exactly like opinio ->
// opinio.
//
// What crossfades is the ROWS, not the card. Stacking two whole cards doubles a
// translucent background, a hairline ring and a shadow for the length of the
// swap, which reads as the caption darkening every time you open an opinio.
// The shell - background, blur, ring, padding, container query - stays put as one
// object and its contents change, which is also the truer description of what
// this thing is.
//
// The two must overlap rather than queue. Measured against a click, a
// leave-then-enter sequence settled ~450ms after the profile modal it captions
// (170ms of leave before 340ms of enter, plus the mark/name stagger) and read as
// the caption trailing the modal; overlapped, both land within ~50ms of each
// other. Same reason the leave is the shorter of the two: it is spending its
// time underneath the arriving subject, not in front of the reader.

// py-[14px] rather than the 12 a py-3 would give: the extra 2px top and bottom
// buy the row breathing room AND drop the title's first line clear of the close
// button's 34px corner, which is what the padding used to be inflated to solve.
// The shell: everything that stays put while the subject changes - the surface,
// the ring, the blur, the padding, and the container query the type is sized
// from. It holds no layout of its own beyond the stack; the row does that.

const ROW = 'flex w-full items-center justify-center gap-4';

// Both rows occupy the same grid cell, so the outgoing one keeps its place under
// the incoming one for the length of the crossfade instead of being laid out
// beside it. Grid rather than absolute positioning: the cell still takes part in
// sizing, so the shell keeps the row's height with no explicit height anywhere.
const STACK = '[grid-area:1/1]';

// The avatar's mirror on the far side. Without it the centred group is the avatar
// PLUS the text, so the text itself sits half an avatar right of the card's
// centre line - visible at any width, and the thing that made the caption look
// subtly off. With it the text column is centred on the card and the avatar hugs
// its left edge. It is not the old fixed 52px track, though - it is the ONLY
// shrinkable item in the row, so a name that needs the width takes all of it back
// and only then does the group go flush.
//
// "Only" is load-bearing, and it cannot be done with a shrink factor. Flex splits
// a deficit across every shrinkable item in proportion to basis x factor, so
// however large a factor this spacer carries, the text column still absorbs a
// sliver - and a sliver is all it takes to wrap a line. Measured on the live page:
// a 686px card left the spacer holding 19px while the column sat at 543 against a
// name that needed 543.x, so the last word dropped to a second line with the room
// to fit it sitting right there, unused. The column is shrink-0 and bounded by a
// max-width instead, which leaves this the only item that can yield.
const SPACER = 'w-[52px]';

// flex-col-REVERSE keeps the source order h1-then-h2 while the kicker still
// renders above the name, so the heading outline never runs an h2 ahead of the
// h1. No flex-1, so a short name leaves the group hugging its own width and
// centred.
//
// shrink-0 with a max-width rather than a shrink factor - see SPACER for why. The
// bound is the row's own arithmetic: 100% is the card's content box, less the 52px
// avatar and the two 16px gaps, which is exactly what the column can occupy once
// the spacer has collapsed. Keep it in step with the avatar size and the row gap.
